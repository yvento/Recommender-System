# Personalized Recommender System

This project implements a sophisticated machine learning-based recommender system that personalizes product suggestions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Developed in Python and integrated with a Flask web application, it aims to enhance user experience on e-commerce platforms by tailoring recommendations to individual user preferences.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Leverages user-item interaction data to generate tailored product suggestions.
- **SVD Algorithm**: Utilizes SVD for accurate prediction of user preferences.
- **Flask Application**: Includes a Flask web application for easy demonstration and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Designed to efficiently handle large datasets and user bases.
